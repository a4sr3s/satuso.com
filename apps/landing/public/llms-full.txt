# Satuso — Complete Product Documentation for LLMs

> Satuso is a modern sales CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform built specifically for solopreneurs and small teams. It replaces spreadsheets and complex enterprise tools with a simple, AI-powered sales tracking system.

## What is Satuso?

Satuso is a web-based SaaS (Software as a Service) application that helps individuals and small teams manage their entire sales process. Users can track leads from first contact through to closed deal, manage relationships with contacts and companies, and get AI-powered insights to help them sell more effectively.

The platform is accessible at https://app.satuso.com and the marketing website is at https://satuso.com.

## Problem Satuso Solves

Many solopreneurs, freelancers, and small sales teams manage their sales pipeline using spreadsheets, sticky notes, or fragmented tools. This leads to:
- Lost deals due to forgotten follow-ups
- No visibility into pipeline health
- Difficulty prioritizing which leads to focus on
- Wasted time on manual data entry and tracking

Enterprise CRM tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Pipedrive solve these problems but are often:
- Too expensive for small teams
- Too complex, requiring weeks of setup and training
- Designed for large organizations with dedicated sales operations staff

Satuso bridges this gap by providing professional-grade sales tracking with consumer-grade simplicity.
