You're a solopreneur. You wear every hat. Marketing, sales, delivery, finance — it's all you. So when someone suggests you need a CRM, your first thought might be: "I'm one person. I don't need Salesforce."

And you're right — you don't need Salesforce. But you might need a CRM. Here's how to tell.

## Signs you need a CRM

- You've forgotten to follow up with a prospect (more than once)
- You can't remember the details of your last conversation with a lead
- You're not sure how many active deals you have right now
- Your "system" is a mix of email, sticky notes, and memory
- You've lost a deal because you dropped the ball on a follow-up

If any of these sound familiar, a CRM will pay for itself quickly.

## Signs you don't need a CRM (yet)

- You have fewer than 5 active prospects at any time
- Your sales cycle is very short (same-day close)
- You don't do outbound sales at all
- You're purely referral-based and never need to track conversations

## What to look for in a solopreneur CRM

Enterprise CRMs are built for large teams with dedicated admins. As a solopreneur, you need something different:

### 1. Fast setup
You should be able to start using it within minutes, not days. No lengthy onboarding, no required training videos.

### 2. Simple interface
You don't need 200 fields per contact. You need name, company, deal value, stage, and notes. That's it.

### 3. Built-in follow-up reminders
The whole point is to stop forgetting. Your CRM should nudge you when it's time to reach out.

### 4. Visual pipeline
Seeing all your deals at a glance — which ones are moving, which ones are stuck — is the most valuable feature a CRM can offer a solopreneur.

### 5. Affordable pricing
You're a team of one. You shouldn't be paying per-seat enterprise pricing.

## The solopreneur CRM trap

Many solopreneurs fall into two traps:

**Trap 1: Using a CRM that's too complex.** They sign up for HubSpot or Salesforce, spend hours configuring it, and abandon it within a month because it's overkill.

**Trap 2: Using nothing at all.** They convince themselves they can remember everything. They can't. Deals fall through the cracks, and they don't even realize it.

The sweet spot is a CRM built specifically for solopreneurs and small teams — one that gives you pipeline visibility and follow-up tracking without the enterprise bloat.

## How Satuso fits

[Satuso](/about) was built for exactly this use case. Visual pipeline, contact management, SPIN selling notes, follow-up reminders — and nothing you don't need. No 6-month implementation. No per-seat pricing that scales against you.
