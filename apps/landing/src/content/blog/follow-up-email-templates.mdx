The fortune is in the follow-up — but only if your follow-up emails actually get read. Most follow-ups fail because they're either too generic ("Just checking in!") or too pushy ("Are you ready to buy?").

Here are 5 templates that strike the right balance.

## 1. After a discovery call

**Subject:** Quick recap from our chat

> Hi [Name],
>
> Great talking with you today. Here's a quick summary of what we covered:
>
> - [Key pain point they mentioned]
> - [Solution you discussed]
> - [Next step you agreed on]
>
> I'll [do the next action] by [date]. In the meantime, feel free to reach out with any questions.
>
> Talk soon,
> [Your name]

**Why it works:** It proves you were listening, reinforces the value, and confirms the next step. No ambiguity.

## 2. After sending a proposal (no response)

**Subject:** Any questions on the proposal?

> Hi [Name],
>
> I wanted to check if you had a chance to look over the proposal I sent on [date]. I know things get busy — happy to jump on a quick 10-minute call to walk through it if that's easier.
>
> Is there anything I can clarify?
>
> Best,
> [Your name]

**Why it works:** It's helpful, not pushy. You're offering to make their life easier, not demanding a decision.

## 3. The "breakup" email

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

> Hi [Name],
>
> I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back, so I want to be respectful of your time. If now isn't the right time, I completely understand.
>
> If anything changes down the road, I'm here. I'll go ahead and close out your file for now unless I hear otherwise.
>
> All the best,
> [Your name]

**Why it works:** Loss aversion is powerful. Nobody likes the idea of their "file being closed." This email gets more responses than any other template.

## 4. Re-engaging a cold lead

**Subject:** [Name], thought of you

> Hi [Name],
>
> We spoke back in [month] about [topic]. I just [saw something relevant / released a new feature / read an article] that reminded me of the challenge you mentioned with [specific problem].
>
> Would it be worth reconnecting for a quick chat?
>
> Best,
> [Your name]

**Why it works:** It's personal, relevant, and gives them a reason to re-engage beyond "I want to sell you something."

## 5. After a meeting with no clear next step

**Subject:** Next steps?

> Hi [Name],
>
> Thanks for taking the time to meet today. I enjoyed learning about [something specific about their business].
>
> Based on our conversation, I think the logical next step would be [specific next step]. Does that work for you? I'm free [suggest 2-3 time slots].
>
> Looking forward to it,
> [Your name]

**Why it works:** You're taking the initiative and making it easy for them to say yes.

## The secret ingredient: timing

The best follow-up email in the world fails if you send it at the wrong time — or forget to send it at all. That's why tracking follow-ups in your CRM is critical.
