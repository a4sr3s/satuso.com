If you're a solopreneur or running a small team, you probably don't have a formal sales pipeline. Maybe you track deals in a spreadsheet, or worse — in your head. The problem is that without a pipeline, deals slip through the cracks. You forget to follow up, you lose track of where each prospect stands, and revenue becomes unpredictable.

Here's how to build a pipeline that works, even if it's just you.

## What is a sales pipeline?

A sales pipeline is a visual representation of where your deals stand in the sales process. Think of it as a series of stages that a prospect moves through — from first contact to closed deal.

A typical pipeline might look like this:

1. **Lead** — Someone has shown interest
2. **Qualified** — You've confirmed they're a good fit
3. **Proposal Sent** — You've shared pricing or a proposal
4. **Negotiation** — You're working out the details
5. **Closed Won** — The deal is done

## Step 1: Define your stages

Don't overthink this. Start with 4–6 stages that match how you actually sell. If you're a consultant, your stages might be: Discovery Call → Proposal → Contract Review → Signed. If you sell a product, it might be: Demo → Trial → Purchase Order → Closed.

The key is that each stage should represent a clear milestone in your sales process.

## Step 2: Add your existing deals

Go through your email, your notes, your calendar — anywhere you've been tracking prospects. Add every active opportunity to your pipeline. For each deal, note:

- Company or contact name
- Estimated deal value
- What stage they're in
- When you last talked to them

## Step 3: Set follow-up reminders

The biggest pipeline killer is forgetting to follow up. Every deal in your pipeline should have a next action and a date. "Send proposal by Friday." "Follow up after their board meeting next Tuesday."

## Step 4: Review weekly

Block 30 minutes once a week to review your pipeline. Move deals forward, remove dead ones, and identify which prospects need attention. This single habit will improve your close rate more than any tool or technique.

## Why spreadsheets don't cut it

Spreadsheets work when you have 5 deals. When you have 20 or 50, they become a mess. You can't easily see your pipeline at a glance, set reminders, or track the history of each deal.

A purpose-built CRM like [Satuso](/about) gives you a visual pipeline with drag-and-drop deal management, built-in follow-up reminders, and deal history — without the complexity of enterprise tools like Salesforce.

## Get started today

You don't need a perfect pipeline on day one. Start with your stages, add your deals, and commit to a weekly review. The pipeline will evolve as your sales process matures.
