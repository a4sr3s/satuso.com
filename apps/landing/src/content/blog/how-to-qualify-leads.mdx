When you're a solopreneur or small team, time is your most scarce resource. Spending two weeks nurturing a lead who was never going to buy is time you can't get back. That's why lead qualification matters — and why most people do it wrong.

## What is lead qualification?

Lead qualification is the process of determining whether a prospect is a good fit for your product or service. A qualified lead has:

- A problem you can solve
- The budget to pay for it
- The authority to make the decision
- A timeline for making a change

If any of these are missing, the deal is unlikely to close — no matter how good your pitch is.

## The BANT framework

BANT stands for Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline. It's one of the oldest qualification frameworks, and it works:

- **Budget** — Can they afford your solution?
- **Authority** — Are you talking to the decision-maker?
- **Need** — Do they have a real problem you can solve?
- **Timeline** — Are they looking to make a change now, or "someday"?

You don't need to ask these questions directly. Instead, weave them into your discovery conversation naturally.

## Better questions to ask

Instead of "What's your budget?" try:

- "How are you currently solving this problem, and what does that cost you?"
- "If we found a solution that worked, what would the process look like on your end to get it approved?"
- "What's driving the urgency around fixing this?"
- "Have you looked at other solutions? What did you think?"

These questions get you the same information without feeling like an interrogation.

## Red flags to watch for

Some prospects will never convert. Learn to spot these early:

- **"We're just researching"** — No timeline, no urgency.
- **"I'd need to run it by my boss/partner/board"** — You're not talking to the decision-maker.
- **"We don't really have a budget for this"** — They may want it, but they can't buy it.
- **Ghost after the first call** — If they're not responsive early, it won't get better.

This doesn't mean you should never pursue these leads. But they should be in a different bucket than your hot prospects.

## Track qualification in your CRM

The biggest mistake is not tracking what you learn. After each conversation, log your BANT findings in your CRM. This way, when you review your pipeline, you can immediately see which deals are strong and which are long shots.

[Satuso](/about) makes this easy with built-in [SPIN selling notes](/blog/what-is-spin-selling) for every deal. You can log what you've learned about each prospect's situation, problems, implications, and needs — so you always know where you stand.

## The 80/20 rule of sales

Roughly 80% of your revenue will come from 20% of your leads. Qualification helps you identify that 20% faster so you can focus your limited time where it matters most.
