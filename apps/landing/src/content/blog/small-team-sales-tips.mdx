It's intimidating when you're a 2-person team competing against companies with 50 sales reps, a dedicated sales ops team, and an unlimited software budget. But small teams have real advantages that enterprise sales orgs can't replicate. Here's how to use them.

## 1. Be faster

Enterprise sales teams have layers of approval, handoffs between SDRs, AEs, and managers, and internal bureaucracy that slows everything down. You don't.

When a prospect reaches out, respond within the hour — not the next business day. When they ask for a proposal, send it the same day. Speed is your superpower.

## 2. Build real relationships

Enterprise reps are often measured on volume. They're juggling 100+ accounts and can't give each one deep attention. You can.

Learn your prospect's name, their business, their challenges. Reference details from your last conversation. These small things build trust that no enterprise rep can match at scale.

## 3. Be the expert, not the middleman

In large orgs, the person you talk to often isn't the person who built the product or delivers the service. They're reading from scripts and passing questions to someone else.

As a small team, you *are* the expert. You built it. You deliver it. That direct access to expertise is incredibly valuable to buyers.

## 4. Customize your approach

Enterprise sales teams use standardized decks, templated proposals, and rigid processes. You can tailor every interaction to the specific prospect.

Customize your demo to show their use case. Write a proposal that addresses their specific problems. This level of personalization wins deals.

## 5. Price competitively

You don't have the overhead of a 50-person sales team, a fancy office, and layers of management. Pass those savings to your customers. Competitive pricing — especially with transparent, simple pricing — is a major advantage against bloated enterprise offerings.

## 6. Use a CRM built for your size

Enterprise CRMs like Salesforce are designed for teams of 50+. They come with complexity, long setup times, and features you'll never use. Using one as a small team actually slows you down.

Instead, use a CRM built for small teams. [Satuso](/about) gives you pipeline management, contact tracking, and follow-up reminders without the enterprise overhead. You'll spend time selling, not configuring software.

## 7. Follow up relentlessly

Studies show that 80% of sales require at least 5 follow-ups, but most reps give up after 2. Enterprise reps are constantly being reassigned accounts and losing context. As a small team, you own the entire relationship.

Set follow-up reminders for every deal. Track your conversations. Be the person who always follows through. Over time, this consistency beats any enterprise sales playbook.

## The bottom line

You don't need a big team to win big deals. You need to be fast, personal, expert, and consistent. These are things that actually get harder as teams grow — which means your size is an advantage, not a limitation.
